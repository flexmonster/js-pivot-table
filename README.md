## What is JS Pivot Table by Flexmonster?

Flexmonster Pivot Table & Charts is a component for interactive pivot reports that can be [inserted to a web page or a web application](http://www.flexmonster.com/demos/pivot-table-js/). It’s a powerful JavaScript tool to visualize your business data.

With Flexmonster, you have no limitation on server-side technology, no matter whether your website runs on .NET, Java, PHP, Ruby, etc.

## Why use Flexmonster Pivot Table & Charts?

### Easy to integrate

Flexmonster Pivot Table & Charts can be natively used with JavaScript or [TypeScript](http://www.flexmonster.com/doc/integration-with-typescript/). It perfectly integrates with [Angular](http://www.flexmonster.com/doc/integration-with-angular/), [React](http://www.flexmonster.com/doc/integration-with-react/), [Vue](http://www.flexmonster.com/doc/integration-with-vue/), and many other frameworks - see our [Integration with frameworks](https://www.flexmonster.com/doc/integration/) section.

### Supports the most common data sources

- [JSON](http://www.flexmonster.com/doc/json-data-source/)
- [CSV](http://www.flexmonster.com/doc/csv-data-source/)
- [SQL databases](https://www.flexmonster.com/doc/connect-to-relational-database/) (MS SQL, MySQL, and others)
- [Microsoft Analysis Services OLAP cubes](http://www.flexmonster.com/doc/connecting-to-microsoft-analysis-services/)
- [Custom data source API](https://www.flexmonster.com/doc/introduction-to-custom-data-source-api/)
- [Elasticsearch](https://www.flexmonster.com/doc/connecting-to-elasticsearch/)
- [Mondrian](http://www.flexmonster.com/doc/connecting-to-pentaho-mondrian/)

### High speed in visualizing your data 

Our solution allows you to work extremely fast with really [large data volumes](http://www.flexmonster.com/demos/) (huge OLAP cubes, data sets from SQL databases, or files up to 100MB). The maximum data size is limited only by end-user browsers and the capacity of their devices. The table renders multiple millions of cells immediately. If the user’s browser can handle it, we’ll display it.

To gain even better performance while working with JSON, CSV, and datasets from SQL databases, use [Flexmonster Data Server](https://www.flexmonster.com/doc/getting-started-with-flexmonster-data-server/) - a special server developed by Flexmonster. It fetches data from a data source, processes, aggregates it, and then passes to Flexmonster Pivot in a ready-to-show format. The Data Server significantly reduces data loading time and allows you to analyze large datasets (CSV and JSON files more than 1 GB).

Working with OLAP cubes, a browser component can communicate with the server via XMLA protocol, or you can use [Flexmonster Accelerator for OLAP cubes](http://www.flexmonster.com/blog/flexmonster-data-speed-accelerator-for-olap-cubes-we-show-multidimensional-data-10-times-faster/). It’s a special server-side proxy that helps you increase data loading speed from server to customer’s browser tenfold.

### Smart features to analyze and manage your data

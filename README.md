## What is JS Pivot Table by Flexmonster?

Flexmonster Pivot Table & Charts is a component for interactive pivot reports that can be [inserted to a web page or a web application](http://www.flexmonster.com/demos/pivot-table-js/). It’s a powerful JavaScript tool to visualize your business data.

Moreover, you have no limitation on the server-side technology, no matter whether your website runs on .NET, Java, PHP, Ruby, etc.

## Why use Flexmonster Pivot Table & Charts?

### Easy to integrate

Flexmonster Pivot Table & Charts can be natively used with JavaScript or [TypeScript](http://www.flexmonster.com/doc/integration-with-typescript/) and perfectly integrates with frameworks such as [Angular](http://www.flexmonster.com/doc/integration-with-angular/), [React](http://www.flexmonster.com/doc/integration-with-react/), [Vue](http://www.flexmonster.com/doc/integration-with-vue/), and many more - see our [Integration with frameworks](https://www.flexmonster.com/doc/integration/) section.

### Supports the most common data sources

- [JSON](http://www.flexmonster.com/doc/json-data-source/)
- [CSV](http://www.flexmonster.com/doc/csv-data-source/)
- [SQL databases](https://www.flexmonster.com/doc/connect-to-relational-database/) (MS SQL, MySQL and others)
- [Microsoft Analysis Services OLAP cubes](http://www.flexmonster.com/doc/connecting-to-microsoft-analysis-services/)
- [Custom data source API](https://www.flexmonster.com/doc/introduction-to-custom-data-source-api/)
- [Elasticsearch](https://www.flexmonster.com/doc/connecting-to-elasticsearch/)
- [Mondrian](http://www.flexmonster.com/doc/connecting-to-pentaho-mondrian/)

### High speed in visualizing your data 

Our solution allows you to work extremely fast with really [large data volumes](http://www.flexmonster.com/demos/) (huge OLAP cubes, data sets from SQL databases, or files up to 100MB). Maximum data size is limited only by end-user browsers and the capacity of their devices. The table renders multiple millions of cells immediately. If the user’s browser can handle it, we’ll display it.

To gain even better performance while working with JSON, CSV, and datasets from SQL databases, use [Flexmonster Data Server](https://www.flexmonster.com/doc/getting-started-with-flexmonster-data-server/) - a special server developed by Flexmonster. It fetches data from a data source, processes, aggregates it, and then passes to Flexmonster Pivot in a ready-to-show format. The Data Server significantly reduces the time of data loading and allows you to analyze large datasets (CSV and JSON files more that 1 GB).

Working with OLAP cubes, a browser component can communicate with the server via XMLA protocol or you can use [Flexmonster Accelerator for OLAP cubes](http://www.flexmonster.com/blog/flexmonster-data-speed-accelerator-for-olap-cubes-we-show-multidimensional-data-10-times-faster/). It’s a special server-side proxy that helps you to increase data loading speed from server to customer’s browser tenfold.

### Smart features to analyze and manage your data

### Compose report layout
Select which dimensions & values to show.
Users can easily change a report layout visually and examine the data from a different perspective. The power of the report composing allows you to stop guessing all possible report scenarios your end-users might require. The user will be able to tune it to their needs on the fly.

### Save & load reports
Users can create reports, save them to their local drive or the server, and load previously saved reports with exactly the same configurations.

This allows users to work with a predefined set of reports or create & save their own reports. Once a user has composed a report, they may want to save it for the future or share it with others.

### Export & print

All table views (Pivot / Flat / Classic) and charts view can be [printed or exported](https://www.flexmonster.com/doc/export-and-print/). Users can export the reports into a variety of formats:
- Microsoft Excel 7
- PDF
- HTML page
- CSV (comma separated text format)
- Image (PNG)   

You can control where to save the export data:
- to the local computer
- to a server (to a remote file storage or database)
